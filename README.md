**Hector ORM** is a modern, modular, and lightweight Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for PHP.

It features a fully decoupled architecture, offering individual components for collections, connections, data types,
schema introspection, and query building.  
You can use each package independently or as part of the complete Hector ORM solution.

> **All development, issues, and pull requests are managed in this monorepo.**  
> Sub-repositories are automatically synchronized for each package.
